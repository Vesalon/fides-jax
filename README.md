# Fides - A python package for Trust Region Optimization

Fides is named after the Roman Goddess of trust and reliability. Fides
implements an Interior Trust Region method based on the papers
[ColemanLi1994] and [ColemanLi1996], which is similar to the 
trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented in the matlab toolbox fmincon.
